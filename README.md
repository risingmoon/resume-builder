Resume Builder
==============

The Resume Builder provides a centralized location for users to store their work history, and a source to generate multiple tailored resumes in PDF format.

After users finished inputing their background information, an resume outline will be created with all their data. Users select entries they wanted for their resumes with checkboxes and all checked records will be carried to the template generator.

In the template generator, user edits and tailors the entries according to the job description. Changes to records will generate new records that relate to the original records. User will name their template and all records and layouts will be tied to template name tags, as well as other key words.

Once templates are complete, user can save the html file as a PDF.

Process:

Data Entry > Resume Outline > Template > PDF
